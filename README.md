This is a trading bot project.

We will develop this product using the following strategy and principles

-We need to optimize token utilization and continuity, since each session with the LLM provider is limited in the amount of tokens that can be used in a given chat, we need to make sure that work that is being done is tracked somewhere in a way that the next session can pick up where the previous one left off.

-We will create management folders/files ("Reference files") for each feature / requirement if not already created. Such as project overview, project road map, and any other project management related files.  These files will summarize the objective of the development of the feature, as well as summarize the work  that has been done so far, as well as what needs to be done next, so that the next session can pick up from there. (provide sufficient context)

-We will create a project management folder in the root project dir if not already created. This folder will contain all of the high level project management info. 


In the root dir, there should be a file with an index of each of the Reference Files with short description of that file (Index file)

The “000_start_here.txt” file in the root dir that provides information to any new sessions on how to contribute to the project (Maintaining a dependencies file and other such standard dev practices) Basic rules and information about project structure. The Start file will point to the “current phase” file. This file is where sessions will update what work is complete, and where they left off, and what the next steps are so that the next session can pick up where the last left off ( to maintain context and continuity between sessions)

The project roadmap will be made up of phases of the project. When we start each new phase, we will create a file, for ex: “Phase_3_checklist” which will be a detailed checklist of each thing that needs to be done for that phase. At the top of the checklist there will be a description of the overall objectives of the phase. 

Only the project manager can update the Start file. Lets start by setting up the basic structure for the project.
