# Trading Bot Project Guide

## Project Structure Overview
- `/project_management/` - High-level project management information
- `/reference_files/` - Feature-specific documentation and progress tracking
- `index.txt` - Index of all reference files
- `current_phase.txt` - Current project phase and progress tracking

## Development Guidelines
1. Always update the current_phase.txt file with:
   - Completed work
   - Current progress
   - Next steps
   
2. When working on features:
   - Check corresponding reference file in /reference_files/
   - Update progress in the reference file
   - Ensure continuity between sessions

3. Project Phases:
   - Each phase has its own checklist file
   - Follow phase objectives and requirements
   - Mark items complete as you progress

4. Dependencies Management:
   - All new dependencies must be documented
   - Use package.json for Node.js dependencies
   - Document external service dependencies separately
